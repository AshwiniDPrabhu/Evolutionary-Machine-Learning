# Evolutionary-Machine-Learning

This repository contains implementations of evolutionary machine learning algorithms for different data sets. 

1. Genetic Algorithm for Titanic Data Set
 - Has implementation of genetic algorithm. Compares the results obtained from neural network with back propogation with results obtained from genetic algorithm for titanic dataset.
 
 2. Particle Swarm Optimization for SineWave Dataset
 - Compares the results obtained from neural network with back propogation with results obtained from applying Particle Swarm Optimization for sinewave dataset.
 
 3. Evolutionary strategy for SineWave data set 
  - Has implementaion of Evolutionary strategy and compares the result obtained from neural network with back propogation for sinewave dataset
  
 4. Genetic programming for Wisconsin breast cancer dataset
  - Has implementation of genetic programming. Also, has tree representation of program with arithmetic and if-then-else functions at internal tree nodes.
  
 5. XCS Algorithm for Wisconsin breast cancer dataset
 - Has implementation of XCS algorithm and compares the results obtained with that of genetic programming.
